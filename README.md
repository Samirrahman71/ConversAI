# 🧠 ConversAI

ConversAI is a clean and simple AI chatbot built just for fun — like a stripped-down version of ChatGPT that lives on your browser. It’s fast, distraction-free, and runs on top of OpenAI’s language model API.

## 💡 Why I Built This

I wanted to build something lightweight that lets people have AI conversations without all the extra stuff — no login, no clutter, just straight-up chatting. It's also a fun way to play around with UI design, OpenAI’s API, and frontend deployment tools like Netlify.

## ⚙️ What’s Under the Hood

- **Frontend:** HTML + TailwindCSS + JavaScript
- **AI Brain:** OpenAI GPT (3.5 or 4, depending on your key)
- **Hosting:** Netlify (free tier FTW)

No backend needed — this version talks to OpenAI’s API directly from the client (make sure you don’t expose your key if you fork this).

## 🧪 Key Features

- Clean, dark-themed chat interface
- Mobile-friendly and super fast
- Messages feel like texting with a bot friend
- Easy to customize (just one main HTML file)

🙋‍♂️ About Me
Hi! I’m Samir — a student and aspiring SRE/security engineer. I’ve interned at Nutanix, worked at Apple, and built a few AI tools on the side. This was a fun weekend project to level up my frontend + API skills.

Feel free to fork it or use it as inspiration for your own AI tools. If you build something cool with it, I’d love to see!
